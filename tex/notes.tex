\title{\bf Miscellaneous Notes}

\section{Ultra diffuse galaxies (UDGs)}

Generally defined as galaxies with central surface brightness fainter
than 24 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. These have been found by the DragonFly
collaboration, by HyperSuprimeCam, and are expected in Rubin
Observatory and Roman Space Telescope data. Some of them at least are
highly dark matter dominated, based on measured velocity dispersion
but also on their number of globular clusters (i.e. $10^{12}$
$M_\odot$ halo; Wasserman et al. 2019).

They can have very dense nuclear star clusters, which can hold around
1\% of the stars (SMUDGES studies from Zaritzky et al, Khim et al).

\section{AGN in Dwarf Galaxies}

Since around 2010 there have been an increasing number of detections
of AGN in dwarf galaxies.  Reines et al. (2013) searched the NASA
Sloan Atlas using the optical BPT diagram and found a fraction around
0.13\% for galaxies with $M<3\times 10^9 M_\odot$, which is
considerably smaller than the fraction for higher mass galaxies.
Trump et al. (2015) looked at the selection effects in detecting AGN
through BPT, and in that paper the lower AGN fraction at lower masses
could be mostly explained with a constant Eddington ratio
distribution. Satyapal et al (2014) and Marleau et al (2014) have both
searched for dwarf galaxy AGN in the mid-IR, finding larger
fractions. Sartori et al. (2015) repeated both analyses in the optical
and in the mid-IR. However, the mid-IR studies have not accounted for
selection effects.

Penny et al. (2018) found several quenched galaxies with AGN and
apparent outflow signatures (only one with mid-IR signatures of an
AGN); these may be similar to higher-mass ``red geyser'' galaxies.
Manzano-King et al. (2019) used Keck/LRIS and Liu et al (2020) used
Keck/KCWI 

\section{AGN Radio Loud, Radio Quiet Dichotomy}

It is believed that AGN have a bimodal dichotomy between radio loud
and radio quiet populations.  Strittmatter et al (1980) pointed this
out, and his results appeared to be confirmed by Kellerman et al
(1989). It is from Kellerman that we get the standard definition of
radio loudness, which is $R = f_{\nu, {\rm 6~cm}} / f_{\nu,
  4400\AA}$. The evidence for the radio loudness bimodality from that
paper can be found in Figure \ref{fig:kellerman89a}.

Papers to look at:
 * Ivezic (2002), Laor (2003), Ho (2002)
