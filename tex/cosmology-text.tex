\section{Basics \& Nomenclature}

The universe is expanding. What that means is that at some point all
of the known universe was previously in a tiny space. Since that time
it has expanded dramatically. This expansion can be seen today in the
fact that more distant galaxies are moving faster away from us, the
{\it Hubble Law}.

Consider the gravitational dynamics of such a universe, assuming it is
homogeneous. The general relativistic version of this picture can be
derived from the Einstein equations. This approach is necessary to
understand how light travels through the resulting curved space-time
of the universe.

However, to just understand the dynamics of the expansion a
straightforward Newtonian approach suffices.  Assume a homogeneous,
expanding universe, and pick some center.  Consider some particle a
distance $r$ from the center today. Since the universe has to remain
homogeneous, it doesn't matter which direction it is in.  The particle
will be moving radially from the center. In fact, at one point it must
have been at radius zero. Let us express its distance as a function of
time as $a(t)r$ where $a(t_0 = {\rm now}) = 1$. Newton's laws mean
that the gravitational force is just due to the mass interior to $r$;
alternatively, the motion of the % particle is driven by the energy
equation, where the potential is given by the Keplerian potential due
to the mass interior:
\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 + m \phi(a(t) r) = \frac{1}{2} m v^2 -
\frac{GM(<a(t) r)m}{a(t) r} - \frac{m\Lambda}{6} a^2(t) r^2 =
\mathrm{~constant}
\end{equation}
The $\Lambda$ accounts for the cosmological constant (in general
relatively, introducing $\Lambda$ is fairly harmless, which we do not
demonstrate here). The equations here are only valid when the universe
is matter-dominated; the earlier phase when the universe was
radiation-dominated requires some relativity to understand. But this
simplistic approach demonstrates the differences between $E<0$ (closed
universe), $E=0$ (``flat'' universe), and $E>0$ (open universe).

We define $H=v/a(t)r$. Note that $v={\dot a}(t) r$, so the {\it Hubble
  parameter} $H(z)$ is:
\begin{equation}
  H(t) = \frac{\dot a}{a}
\end{equation}

We define also:
\begin{eqnarray}
\Omega_k &=& \frac{2Ea^2(t) r^2}{mH^2} \cr
\Omega_m &=& \frac{8\pi G\rho}{3H^2}\cr
\Omega_\Lambda &=& \frac{\Lambda}{3H^2} 
\end{eqnarray}
$\Omega_m$ is the scaled matter density, $\Omega_\Lambda$ is the
contribution of the matter density, and for reasons that become clear
in the general relativistic picture, 

Under these definitions:
\begin{equation}
\Omega_k + \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda = 1
\end{equation}
at all times.
  
The parameters $\Omega_{m0}$ and $\Omega_{\Lambda 0}$ are the present
time values of the matter density and the cosmological constant, and
they are roughly $0.25$--$0.30$ and $0.70$--$0.75$ respectively.  The
curvature $\Omega_k$ is consistent with zero within $0.02$ or so.
The Hubble parameter today is $H_0 \sim 65$--$75$ km/s/Mpc. 

For the majority of galaxies whose distances we have an estimate of,
it comes from the Doppler shift inference of velocity and the Hubble
Law. Two common choices of units are as follows:
\begin{equation}
r {\rm ~in~}h^{-1}{\rm ~Mpc} {\rm ~where~} h = \frac{H_0}{100 {\rm
    ~km/s/Mpc}} 
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}
r {\rm ~in~}h_{70}^{-1}{\rm ~Mpc} {\rm ~where~} h_{70} = \frac{H_0}{70
  {\rm ~km/s/Mpc}}
\end{equation}
The latter is becoming far more standard these days but the former
still abounds.

In homogeneous expansion, the universe just scales overall by the
factor $a(t)$. We can define a {\it comoving coordinate system} that
expands with the universe --- $r$ as used above is the radius in that
coordinate system. In contrast {\it physical} units express a fixed
size.

In the general relativistic picture, the metric for this expanding
universe is:
\begin{equation}
{\rm d}s^2 = c^2 {\rm d}t^2 - a^2(t) \left[ \frac{{\rm d}q^2}{1-Kq^2}
  + q^2\left({\rm d}\theta^2+ \sin^2\theta{\rm d}\phi^2\right) \right] 
\end{equation}
This is the {\it Friemann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric}.  $K$
determines the curvature of space and can be $K=1$, $-1$, or $0$.
$K=0$ corresponds to the $E=0$ and is the ``flat'' case, because the
spatial term is Euclidean (though spacetime is not flat even in this
case).  The FLRW metric is necessary for determining light paths
through the universe.

At low redshift, the expansion velocity translates into a
nonrelativistic Doppler redshift:
\begin{equation} 
\frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda_e} = 1+z  \approx 1 + \frac{v}{c} \approx 1
+ \frac{H_0 d}{c}
\end{equation} 
and so
\begin{equation}
d \approx \frac{cz}{H_0}
\end{equation}
and sometimes the cosmological redshift is expressed in terms of
$v\approx cz$. At high redshift (e.g. above unity), the relationship
between $d$ and $z$ is ambiguous. 

Within the FLRW metric, there is at least a relationship between the
expansion factor $a(t)$ and the redshift that that time is observed at
today:
\begin{equation}
a(t) = \frac{1}{1+z(t)}
\end{equation}
Heuristically, the photons are stretched by the same factor that the
universe has expanded. The exercises derive this more rigorously. 

The FLRW metric allows us to relate intrinsic luminosities and sizes
to observed fluxes and angular sizes of objects at a given
redshift. The focusing theorem in general relativity states that
matter makes light converge. For a flat, matter-dominated universe:
\begin{equation}
D_C= 
\frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{{\rm d}z}{E(z)}
= 
\frac{c}{H_0} \int_0^z \frac{{\rm d}z}{\sqrt{\Omega_{\Lambda0} +
    \Omega_{m0}(1+z)^3}}
\end{equation}
This can be derived from the energy equation quite simply. In a flat
universe, the luminosity distance is simply:
\begin{equation}
D_L = D_C (1+z)
\end{equation}
and the angular diameter distance is:
\begin{equation}
D_A = \frac{D_C}{1+z}
\end{equation}
In non-flat universes things are a bit more complicated
mathematically.

The universe has perturbations and is not quite homogeneous, inducing
motions with respect to the Hubble flow, called {\it peculiar
velocities}.  The observed redshift is due to both effects combined:
\begin{equation}
1+z_{\rm obs} = (1+z_{\rm cosmo})(1+z_{\rm pec})
\end{equation}
Peculiar velocities are typically a few hundred km/s, and are at most
a few thousand, or $\Delta z \sim 0.01$ at the most, but we map the
universe out to much larger redshift. So usually it is adequate to
express this expression as follows:
\begin{equation}
z_{\rm obs} = z_{\rm cosmo}+z_{\rm pec} + z_{\rm cosmo}z_{\rm pec}
\approx z_{\rm cosmo} + \frac{v_{\rm pec}}{c} (1+z_{\rm cosmo})
\end{equation}

The universe does not only contain matter, but contains radiation and
neutrinos and potentially other ingredients. The cosmic microwave
background is observed today as a 2.7 K bath of photons with a nearly
perfect blackbody spectrum.  There is also a bath of neutrinos
surrounding us, of roughly the same density. Together these
relativistic particles have $\Omega_{r0} \sim 4\times 10^{-5}$
$h^{-2}$.

The density of non-relativistic matter scales as $a^{-3}$ but due to
redshift the energy density of relativistic particles scales as
$a^{-4}$. Therefore, sufficiently far into the past (a redshift of
order $\Omega_{m0}/Omega_{r0} \sim 10^4$) the radiation
dominates. This is called the epoch of ``matter-radiation equality.''

The cosmic microwave radiation temperature was higher in the past by a
factor that scales as $1+z$.

The very early universe was very hot. At some point protons, neutrons,
electrons, and photons formed a baryon-photon fluid tightly bound held
in equilibrium by the electromagnetic and weak forces. During big bang
nucleosynthesis, the protons and the neutrons fell out of equilibrium,
and deuterium, ${}^3He$, ${}^4He$ formed, along with some Li. Later,
at recombination, the electrons became bound to the hydrogen
atoms. Since that time, at some point between $z\sim 7$ and 20, the
first stars ionized the gas again.

\section{Analytic Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Energy equation
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{E}{m} &=& \frac{v^2}{2}-\frac{GM}{r} - \frac{\Lambda}{6}a^2(t)r^2 \cr
1 &=& \frac{2E}{mv^2} + \frac{2GM}{a(t) rv^2} -
\frac{\Lambda}{3}\frac{a^2(t) r^2}{v^2} 
\end{eqnarray}
Let us define $H=v/a(t)r$. Note that $v={\dot a}(t) r$, so:
\begin{equation}
H(t) = \frac{\dot a}{a}
\end{equation}
This is the time-dependent Hubble parameter. Also let us express the
mass $M$ in terms of the density: $M=4\pi r^3\rho/3$. Then:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{2Ea^2(t) r^2}{mH^2} + \frac{8\pi
  G\rho}{3H^2}+\frac{\Lambda}{3H^2} &=& 1 \cr 
\Omega_k + \Omega_m + \Omega_\Lambda &=& 1
\end{eqnarray}
Note that the $E=0$ case is just the $\Omega_k=0$ case, where the
spatial curvature is zero. It can be useful to recast this in yet
another way:
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{2Ea^2(t_0) r^2}{mH_0^2} + \frac{8\pi
  G\rho(t_0)}{3H_0^2}+\frac{\Lambda}{3H^2} &=& 1 \cr 
\end{eqnarray}
\item Relate expansion to redshift
A good example of this is getting a general expression for what the
``redshift'' means. In the picture above, clearly the $v$ ought to be
measureable with a Doppler shift. But for large distances it becomes
complicated: the velocities can become close to the speed of light,
how does relativity apply here? the time of emission was actually deep
in the past, how does that affect the perceived velocity? The GR
approach actually clarifies this nicely.

The photons travel along null geodesics. Also, if I am observing
something at some cosmological distance, the photon I actually see has
been traveling radially in the FRW coordinate system center on me
(other photons are going other directions, but I don't see those
ones). So:
\begin{equation}
{\rm d}s^2 = c^2 {\rm d}t^2 - a^2(t) \frac{{\rm d}q^2}{1-Kq^2} = 0
\end{equation}
and therefore:
\begin{equation}
\frac{{\rm d}t^2}{a^2(t)} = \frac{{\rm d}q^2}{c(1-Kq^2)} 
\end{equation}
Now conceive of a wave peak leaving some radius $q$ at some
time $t_e$, and the next one leaving at $t_e+\delta t_e$. Let me
integrate the square root of the above equation over the path taken by
the first:
\begin{equation}
\int_{t_e}^{t_o} \frac{{\rm d}t'}{a(t')} = 
\int_q^0 {\rm d}q' 
\frac{1}{c\sqrt{1-Kq^2}} 
\end{equation}
Note that for both wave peaks, the right hand side is the same,
because they leave from the same radius $q$. Therefore:
\begin{equation}
\int_{t_e}^{t_o} \frac{{\rm d}t'}{a(t')} = 
\int_{t_e+\delta t_e}^{t_o+\delta t_o} \frac{{\rm d}t'}{a(t')} = 
\int_{t_e}^{t_o} \frac{{\rm d}t'}{a(t')} + \frac{\delta t_o}{a(t_o)} -
\frac{\delta t_e}{a(t_e)}
\end{equation}
where the last equation is just from the way integrals are defined.
Then clearly:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\delta t_e}{\delta t_o} = \frac{a(t_e)}{a(t_o)}
\end{equation}
This means that the period of the wave is increasing, so the
wavelength is increasing and the frequency is decreasing. Assuming we
observe at $t_o=t_0$, we can write:
\begin{equation}
a(t_e) = \frac{\nu_o}{\nu_e} = \frac{\lambda_e}{\lambda_o} =
\frac{1}{1+z} 
\end{equation}
where the last equality comes from the definition of redshift $z$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\lambda_o}{\lambda_e} = 1+z 
\end{equation}
You can think of this as the fact that the photons are being stretched
in precisely the same way that the universe is being expanded.
