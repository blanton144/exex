\title{\bf Distance Ladder}

\section{Basics \& Nomenclature}

Determination of distance is a fundamental problem in astronomy, to
which is owed numerous breakthroughs. The distance to nearby galaxies
has been established through a calibrated {\it distance ladder},
refined over the past century.

The distance ladder begins with the measurement of {\it parallax},
which is the apparent motion of sufficiently nearby stars due to the
motion of the Earth around the Sun. Precise measurements of stars over
time in a fixed reference frame yield {\it proper motions} and
parallax-based distances. Most recently, the Gaia satellite has
provided a large sample of stars with measured parallaxes reaching
across our Galaxy.

To reach distances outside our galaxy, we must rely on less direct
measurements of distance. Usually this involves finding objects or
phenomena that have pairs of observables with a known relation but
with different dependences on distance.

Many of these techniques fall into the {\it standard candle} category:
a luminosity is estimated by some means, and a flux is measured, and
the distance is inferred from the inverse-square law $f=L/4\pi D^2$.
The most prominent standard candles are:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\it RR Lyrae} variable stars. These stars are relatively low mass
  horizontal branch stars. They vary due to the $\kappa$ mechanism,
  which is an instability associated with the reaction of the
  atmospheric opacity to changes in pressure and density that causes
  oscillations in stellar size and luminosity.  They have periods of
  order a day. They are prominent in globular clusters but can also be
  found throughout the Milky Way. Historically they have been most
  useful for determining distances within the Galaxy. However, the
  advent of Gaia and the James Webb Space Telescope opens up the
  possibility of observing these stars in nearby galaxies.
\item {\it Cepheid} variable stars. These stars are high mass and
  luminous.  They also vary due to the $\kappa$ mechanism but have
  longer periods. Historically, they have provided one of the most
  direct links between local distance scales and distant galaxies.
\item {\it Type Ia supernovae}. These supernovae result from the
  nuclear detonation of white dwarfs, probably due to accretion from
  or collision with a binary companion. The Phillips relation connects
  the time scale of the supernova light curve to the luminosity of the
  supernova. These sources were used to provide the first definitive
  evidence for the existence of cosmic acceleration.
\end{itemize}
Historically, a number of other distance measurements have also been
used that could be categorized as standard candle distances. Some
methods have relied on other supernova types. Other methods have
generally capitalized on scaling relations of galaxies, such as the
Tully-Fisher relation for spirals relating luminosity and circular
velocity, and the Fundamental Plane for ellipticals relating
luminosity, size, and velocity dispersion. The difficulty in
implementing these methods in a way that is free of systematic errors
generally has led to the use of supernovae for the most recent
measurements of the distance ladder.

Several standard candle techniques on the horizon may prove useful in
the coming years. I will discuss masers and gravitational waves:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Under certain conditions the supermassive
black holes at the centers of galaxies may contain H$_2$O
masers. Under certain conditions, these systems can be sufficiently
clean that one may measure angular velocities of circular orbits and
angular sizes, which yields a period. Combined with a Doppler
velocity, this combination yields the mass of the black hole and the
distance. Only one clean enough system is known, about 8 Mpc away in
NGC 4258.
\item LIGO
  \end{itemize}
