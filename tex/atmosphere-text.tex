\title{\bf Atmospheric effects}

\section{Basics \& Nomenclature}

Ground-based astronomers must reckon with the effect of the atmosphere
on their observations. The atmosphere imprints wavelength-dependent
absorption on the incoming light. It glows with a complex,
time-dependent and space-dependent spectrum.  It refracts the light as
a function of zenith angle and wavelength. Finally, turbulence in the
atmosphere distorts the incoming light's wave fronts, leading to image
motion and blur.

When calculating the effects of the atmosphere, the zenith angle $z$
is a critical factor. In the plane-parallel approximation, which
virtually always holds, the column density of atmosphere at $z$ scales
as the {\it airmass}, $a = 1 / \cos z$. 

Figure \ref{fig:absorption} shows the atmospheric transmission
$t(z=0^\circ)$ as a function of wavelength at sea level. The
transmission at other airmasses is:
\begin{equation}
t(z) = [t(z=0^\circ)]^a,
\end{equation}
where $a$ is the airmass. It also depends on height above sea level.
The sharp absorption features are known as {\it telluric lines}.

The ultraviolet and higher energy photons are essentially entirely
absorbed below $3500$ $\AA$. Starting in the near-infrared, the
atmosphere has strong absorption bands associated with {\bf WHAT}.
The exact level of absorption depends on the humidity and
conditions. This means the transmission spectra depends on time and
the average conditions vary considerably between different
locations. Favorable locations include but are not limited to the high
deserts of Chile and the South Pole.

Figure \ref{fig:emission} shows the atmospheric emission as a function
of wavelength. The components of this emission include a scattered
light component. This scattered light comes primarily from ground
sources and the Moon. When the Moon is out it tends to dominate the
continuum regions of the sky spectra; this spectrum then resembles the
solar spectrum. Other scattered light yields a spectrum that reflects
the light sourc: {\bf lamps}. The scattered light emission is
dependent on Moon phase and angle to the Moon (or to other sources)
and is fairly smoothly varying in time and angle.

Emission also originates from the atmosphere itself. {\bf
describe}. In the optical and near-infrared, this emission is
dominated by fluorescence due to excitation of atoms and molecules,
known as {\it airglow}. Neutral oxygen has several important lines,
and OH$^{-}$ exhibits a suite of rotation-vibrational modes. The
airglow varies rapidly in time (over tens of minutes) and in angle (on
scales of tens of arcminutes). Past 2--3 microns, the spectrum starts
to be dominated by thermal emission (though at these wavelengths the
telescope itself becomes the more important background).

An important source of background emission is also the {\it zodiacal
light}, which originates in the Solar System and concentrated to the
ecliptic plane, with a complex dependence on angle.

The light that is transmitted from outside the atmosphere to the
telescope is also refracted by the atmosphere. At reasonable zenith
angles and almost all conditions, the atmosphere can be treated as
plane parallel, and all that matters for the refraction effects is the
index of refraction at the telescope. This index depends primarily on
pressure (and thus altitude) and to a lesser extent on temperature and
relative humidity. Snell's Law is a strong enough function of zenith
angle that for fields of view above a few arcminutes, usually one
needs to worry about differential refraction across the field inducing
both a monopole and a quadrupole distortion.

Because the index of refraction is a function of wavelength, the
refraction means that the images of different wavelengths will appear
in different locations. In this way, the atmosphere acts as a weak
prism, dispersing the light along the direction to and from zenith,
called the {\it parallactic angle}. This effect can be up to a couple
of arcseconds and so be very significant.

Finally, the light being transmitted usually arrives at the atmosphere
from infinity in plane waves, except in the case of radio waves which
experience interstellar scintillation. These plane waves are distorted
when passing through the atmosphere. These distortions occur because
of turbulent mixing between atmospheric layers with different indices
of refraction, which cause fluctuations in the wave fronts. These
distortions are known generically as {\it seeing}.

Under good conditions, the seeing is dominated by a surface layer near
the telescope and a handful of thin turbulent layers within a few
kilometers of the surface.

\section{Analytic Exercises}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The Cassegraine design and Gregorian design both involve a
curved secondary redirecting the focus along the original primary
focal axis. In the Cassegraine, the secondary is before the prime
focus. In the Gregorian it is after. What are the shapes of each of
these secondary choices: ellipsoid, paraboloid, or hyperboloid? Draw
the mirrors and the paths for on-axis light in the two cases.
\item In the two above cases, there usually needs to be a hole in the
primary mirror (and the secondary would obstruct that area anyway).
What is the analytic form of the diffraction limited point spread
function for an aperture like this?
